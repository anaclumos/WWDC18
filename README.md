## Why I think I got accepted

#### Every information under is purely personal opinion.

At first, I tried to create a game. I thought it would be perfect to fascinate judges in 3 minutes. So I started with studying SpriteKit, but in few days I acknowledged that they are seeking for "talented students." You know, everyone can make a coarse, unrefined game within few days. That's not what they want. They want to see insightful, intelligent, original students, not just a developer who copies and pastes codes. So I abandoned the first playground that I made and started on this playground, only four days ahead of the submission.

Remember, using brand-new Kits and concentrating on ostensible decoration is meaningless. Apple can easily find thousands of those developers around the world. What they seek for, are not those commonplace developers. They want STEM Students with Creativity. Only with brand new Kits with no creativity inside, Apple would not be impressed.

Rather than that, concentrate on the content. Make something original. Apple already stated this as "Build a Swift playground to showcase your ingenuity."

And regarding technical accomplishment, concentrating on the basics operations and perfecting them would seem more "technically accomplished" than making an unfinished, complicated - but not sophisticated - playground.

### Depth
I concentrated on mathematical depth. It makes a visually interactive scene for easily understanding several numerical methods for pi calculation. Also, I tried to annotate all the mathematical properties and details of each technique. Therefore, compared to other playgrounds, the Apple judges must have found this playground more well-founded. Other accepted students also concentrated on various fields: music, art, science, environments...

### Clear topic and unity
When I was preparing the submission, I've downloaded and analyzed almost every accepted playground on GitHub. Most of them had clear topic and message. 3 minutes is not long; you cannot talk about various stuffs. Concentrate on one clear topic, and give a unified and clear experience.

### Originality
For someone who already took AP Computer Science class, these calculations may seem trite, since almost every student attempts implementing Monte Carlo Method for pi calculation in Java. However, I improved upon it. First, I designed my mathematical indicator to easily compare long decimals using log scales, called the Disco Level. Also, I developed my graphing tool that can both display scatterplots for Monte Carlo Method and charts for accurate comparison. These are done solely by myself, without any help.

### Quality
I finished the idea and the code in the first two days. Then for the near two days, I dedicated those time to find every error as possible, and polishing and perfecting the playground. Make sure not to be pressed in time, and devote few days to perfecting the project.

### Essays
Most of the students prioritize developing the playground over the essays. However, I think essays are as crucial as playgrounds, if not more. I invested much time in the composition and revised it several times, even asked my English teacher for advice. An essay can concisely show who you are, and why you want the scholarship. Essays are the critical factor. Make sure they have no typos or grammatical errors.

### Detailed Explanation and step-by-step instructions (Markups)
As I noted, I tried to annotate all the details and reasons behind. Within that process, I kept all the information organized. I made a guided path for judges to read and follow. I explained how you could intuitively change the variables for the calculations. They could merely follow their eyesights and get all the experiences.

Also, I tried to utilize useful markup grammars to emphasize, exemplify, and note specific details. I strongly recommend you to read through the markup reference by Apple.

#### Added on Sep 2019
Things have changed a lot. I do not agree with the above writing and the main essay. Especially for the main essay, it contains some insensitive expressions and ideas that I should have thought more carefully. However, for the sake of making this a `reference material` for other applicants, I will keep its intact form from the day that I applied.
